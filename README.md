SportsGBT Chat App is an Android application that allows users to chat with AI-powered sports personalities. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate responses based on user input.
 *** IMPORTANT TO NOTE *** 
 Due to OpenAI policies, publishing the API Key on Git Hub is forbidden and automatically disables the key. If you wish to run the program on your own I have provided a separate API key for test purposes which can be used. You have to change the key in the OpenAIInterface Class. Here is the test key : "sk-proj-br64CK8IDsfdu9iMTZFbT3BlbkFJWNAHoSdWtMTDA0CeNlUM". The program is fully functional. You can watch how the app works by clicking this link here.
